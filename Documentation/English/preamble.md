# Preamble

## Idea

During the restrictive period with COVID-19 and the lockdowns in Germany, we noticed that schools in Germany are already behind in digitalisation. As a result, students, teachers, school administrators and state educational institutions are not prepared for a disaster situation. For the students, mostly only the private digital devices are available for home schooling. For the teachers, too, there are usually no on-duty digital information processing devices. In international comparison, these circumstances pose a high professional future risk for the affected cohorts.

## this project

With this project, we want to offer schools a fast and cost-effective solution to provide several IT systems for teachers and students quickly and easily. There are no software costs for the educational institutions. The only costs with this method are time, electricity consumption and hardware procurement. Since the Linux distribution Arch is used for this project, the hardware requirements are low and no top-class end device has to be used. Software maintenance is also simple due to the "rolling release". When it comes to updates, you are not tied to specific operating system versions. Updates for the operating system and application software are provided simply and securely for the user by central servers.
The installation of the devices is done by an Ansible script from a central system via network to any number of end devices. The latest software is installed so that the systems can be used safely immediately after installation.
